Everything you can think of,<br> and things you have never dreamed of, lie in wait.<br> Whole roasted cows and pigs and goats still turning<br> on spits. Huge platters of fowl stuffed with<br> savoury fruit and nuts. Ocean creatures drizzled in<br> sauces or begging to be dipped in spicy concoctions. Countless cheeses, <br>breads, vegetables, sweets, waterfalls of wine, <br>and streams of spirits that flicker with flames.','Alfie could put anything on a pizza and make it taste<br> fabulous, I swear he could. There were the days he pulled<br> a plain cheese from the oven just to make us laugh, but most<br> days it was an edible form of his crazy wonderful imagination. <br>It was the thing we looked forward to the <br>most after our day. Nothing surprises us anymore, but we re still <br>amazed each time supper comes around.','The moment I slide into my chair I m served an <br>enormous platter of food. Eggs, ham, piles of fried <br>potatoes. A tureen of fruit sits in ice to keep it <br>chilled. The basket of rolls they set before me <br>would keep my family going for a week. There s an <br>elegant glass of orange juice.','The rich aroma of the dish wafted down and beckoned<br> you.You could not resist the delightful sensations <br>that whipped up inside your memory at the mere <br>thought of delving your teeth deep and fast into the <br>pulpy texture of the pizza. Cheese spread atop in <br>copious amounts and the wide assortment of <br>condiments sprinkled in the perfect amounts mingle <br>to produce a taste unlike any other: salty, peppery, <br>cheesy with a whiff of Italian cuisine and a tinge <br>of Greek taste.','Sasha tool a bite of the omlette, cheesy with dark leafy greens.<br> She smiled, "Tamal, that s so good, what s the green stuff? <br> With a boyish grin he raised his brows, opening up his eyes,<br> "Stinging nettle, chives and dandelion leaves.<br>"Sasha paused as if her thoughts had stopped entirely, "Holy.<br> That tastes good."He gave a shrug, the one he always gave when<br> he was proud of himself but tickled with his own shyness.<br> "Chuck out the stems from the dandelions, boil the rest together for a few minutes,<br> cold water, squeeze, chop. That s it. Sting all gone. Eat what wants to grow, easy.','He licked his fleshy lips and grabbed a handful of oily hâ€™ors devoures.<br> They were little shrimps, fried to a crisp.<br> He placed a pile of shrimp on his plate and drenched them in creamy, <br>sweet sauce. He pudgy hand clenched the oil soaked shrimp and <br>stuffed them into his mouth. His licked his fingers, smeared with cream and oil.<br> He crunched another handful of crispy shrimp. <br>He snatched a large chicken leg and a large steak. He saturated<br> them in the rich, sweet sauce and popped a large chunk of steak into his mouth.<br> The steak was too thick to chew with his mouth closed, not that he was concerned.<br> He practically owned the kingdom, he just had to make the deal official.<br> He dabbed his fleshy cheeks with a delicate napkin before speaking.'];
